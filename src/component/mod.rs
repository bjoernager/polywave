/// Denotes a type suitable for use as a colour component.
///
/// Note that not all components types are necessarily transformable; most colour spaces and formats require some form of floating- or fixed-point arithmetic for transformations to be at least be somewhat accurate.
/// Only the most basic of colours spaces can thus be translated using simple integers.
///
/// Also note that some colour types may be preprogrammed for specific components and are thus not generic or only generic for a specific subset of components types.
/// Usually, this trait is only useful for types that implement [`BalancedColour`](crate::BalancedColour).
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Implementors of this type may not contain any padding.
///
/// Additionally, the component must also have a bit state for denoting `0` (zero), and this state must only contain null bits.
